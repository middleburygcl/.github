Welcome to the Middlebury Polygon Meshing and Rendering (`middpolymer`) Libraries!

This is a collection of libraries for creating, adapting, and visualizing meshes, which can then be used for numerical simulations.

Please see the `wings`, `mapletrees` and `helix` repositories for further information. Some libraries for calculating Voronoi diagrams are currently under development.
